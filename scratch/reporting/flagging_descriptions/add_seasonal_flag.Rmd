# `add_seasonal_flag()`

This function adds three flags:

1. `"outside of seasonal range"`
2. `"slope violation"`
3. `"outside sd range"`

These flags are determined using the values within the the seasonal ranges threshold table which are joined to the data from our cleaned HydroVu API data. The seasonal ranges threshold table holds the thresholds for the 1st and 99th percentile for mean range (`t_mean01, t_mean99`), the 99th percentile for slopes behind (`t_slope_behind_99`), and the standard deviation of the values within the 1st and 99th percentile for each season, site, parameter combination. 

The seasons that we consider in the seasonal ranges threshold table is as follows:

- winter_baseflow = December, January, February, March, April
- snowmelt = May, June
- monsoon = June, July, August
- fall_baseflow = October, November

```{r, eval=FALSE}
add_seasonal_flag <- function(df) {

  site_name <- unique(na.omit(df$site))
  parameter_name <- unique(na.omit(df$parameter))

  lookup <- threshold_lookup %>%
    filter(site == site_name & parameter == parameter_name)

  df <- df %>%
    left_join(lookup, by = "season") %>%
    select(!c(site.y, parameter.y),
           site = site.x,
           parameter = parameter.x) %>%
    # ... flag obs that are outside the seasonal 1-99 percentile range:
    add_flag((mean < t_mean01 | mean > t_mean99), "outside of seasonal range") %>%
    # ... flag obs whose slope is greater than the 99th percentile range
    add_flag((slope_ahead >= t_slope_behind_99 | slope_behind >= t_slope_behind_99), "slope violation") %>%
    # ... flag obs that are outside of the rolling mean times 3 sd's of the 1-99 percentile seasonal values
    add_flag((mean <= rollavg - (3 * t_sd_0199) | mean >= rollavg + (3 * t_sd_0199)), "outside sd range")

  return(df)

}
```

## Add `"outside of seasonal range"` flag.
**The seasonal range flag is triggered when the mean value of a data point exceeds the 1st or 99th quantiles of the mean data for that specific site, parameter, and season combination.**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
add_flag((mean < t_mean01 | mean > t_mean99), 
         paste0("outside of seasonal range"))
```
- `mean` = The average of all the data points collected in a 15 minute period for a sonde parameter.
- `t_mean01` = 1st percentile threshold.
- `t_mean99` = 99th percentile threshold.
- `paste0("outside of seasonal range")` = Flag descriptor inserted into the `flag` column.

## Add `"slope violation"` flag. 
**The slope violation flag is triggered when the slope ahead or behind of a data point exceeds the 99th quantiles of the slope behind for that specific site, parameter, and season combination.**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
add_flag((slope_ahead >= t_slope_behind_99 | slope_behind >= t_slope_behind_99), 
         "slope violation")
```
- `slope_ahead` = The slope between the current data point and the following data point.
- `slope_behind` = The slope between the previous data point and the previous data point.
- `t_slope_behind_99` = 99th percentile slope threshold.
- `"slope violation"` = Flag descriptor inserted into the `flag` column.

## Add `"outside sd range"` flag
**The standard deviation flag is triggered when the mean value of a data point deviates by more than 3 standard deviations from the rolling average.**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
add_flag((mean <= rollavg - (3 * t_sd_1090) | mean >= rollavg + (3 * t_sd_1090)), 
         "outside sd range")
```
- `mean` = The average of all the data points collected in a 15 minute period for a sonde parameter.
- `rollavg` = A rolling average of 7 data points, with the data point that is being evaluated in the center.
- `t_sd_1090` = The seasonal standard deviation within the 10th and 90th quantiles for the season.
- `"outside sd range"` = Flag descriptor inserted into the `flag` column.

### Good
![Example of outside of seasonal range flag working properly](../../../data/QAQC_images/flag_examples/range_good_example.png)

- These points are flagged even though they are pushing the rolling average up.

### Bad
![Example of outside of seasonal range flag working improperly](../../../data/QAQC_images/flag_examples/range_bad_example.png)

- These points are being flagged even though they are legitimate.

## slope violation
```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# explore
# slope_violation_plots
# good example
example_plot_good <- slope_violation_plots[[11]]
ggsave(filename = 'data/QAQC_images/flag_examples/slope_violation_good_example.png',
       plot = example_plot_good,
       height = 8, width = 10)
# bad examples
example_plot_bad <- slope_violation_plots[[1]]
ggsave(filename = 'data/QAQC_images/flag_examples/slope_violation_bad_example.png',
       plot = example_plot_bad,
       height = 8, width = 10)
```

### Good
![Example of slope violation flag working properly](../../../data/QAQC_images/flag_examples/slope_violation_good_example.png)

- This point is flagged for a slope violation.
- This point would not have been capture by the sd or range limit flag. 

### Bad
![Example of slope violation flag working properly](../../../data/QAQC_images/flag_examples/slope_violation_bad_example.png)

## outside sd range

- This point was flagged despite being legitimate.

### Good
![Example of sd flag working properly](../../../data/QAQC_images/flag_examples/timberline_turb_sd_flag_good.png)

- Extreme outliers will be detected and deemed unsuitable.
- This flag is often associated with the seasonal range flag.
- This flag is often associated with the slope violation flag.

### Bad
![Example of sd flag working improperly](../../../data/QAQC_images/flag_examples/timberline_turb_sd_flag_bad.png)

- When several points are following a suspicious trend they are captured in the rolling average window and do not get flagged.
- Fortunately, as this flag is often associated with other flags, those other flags will get triggered as well.
- Even though this flag is working properly, it seems to have captured a real event as false.
