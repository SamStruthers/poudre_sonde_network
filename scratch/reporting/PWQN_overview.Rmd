# Overview of Poudre WQ Projects

Currently we have three ongoing projects in the Cache la Poudre River Watershed looking at various water quality impacts.

## Poudre Water Quality Network (PWQN)

![](images/legacy_20230516_upstream_promo-01.jpg){width="406"}

The PWQN is a collection of river monitoring sites strategically located throughout and directly upstream of the City of Fort Collins. This monitoring partnership with the City of Fort Collins was spurred by the 2018 fish kill throughout the city, whose source was never determined. With a network of sensors deployed, we can better track changes in water quality like those experienced in 2018 and understand how the river is influenced by its myriad urban and agricultural inputs. The PWQN currently exists as nine sites along the Cache la Poudre River from the canyon mouth to Windsor, as well as two tributaries to the Poudre River.

## Reservoir Study

![](images/juan_ptrr_handheld_probe.jpg){width="399"}

The 2020 Cameron Peak wildfire (CPF) was the largest wildfire in Colorado history at over 200,000 acres. The CPF burned a large proportion of the Cache La Poudre watershed, in particular various high elevation reservoirs. These reservoirs provide valuable drinking and agriculutural water to users in the City of Fort Collins, Greeley, Thornton and Northern Water. In collaboration with the Rocky Mountain Research Station (USFS), we are sampling various reservoir, tributary, and mainstem sites of the Cache La Poudre watershed. This field campaign allows us to analyze trends in water quality focusing on nutrients and other key constituents mobilized post-fire. The goal of this project is to understand how these nutrients affect algal growth in reservoirs and how those changes are felt downstream. Using this field data, we are working to create a system that will predict algal blooms before they occur using a combination of in-stream sensors, remote sensing, and field sampling.

## CU Collaboration

![](images/PXL_20230901_195306806.jpg){width="260"}

This collaboration is hoping to assess the usefulness of water quality sensors on being able to quantify the impact of watershed restoration as a means to reduce water treatment burdens. They have installed a few sites on their own but primarily have piggybacked on our existing network and have tasked us with maintaining these sites.
