```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE) 
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
source("src/package_loader.R")
lapply(c("data.table", "tidyverse", "kableExtra"), package_loader)
```

#### The slope deviation flag uses the `add_flag()` method and is triggered when the mean value of a data point deviates by more than 3 standard deviations from the rolling average.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# SD flag
add_flag((mean <= rollavg - (3 * m_sd_1090) | mean >= rollavg + (3 * m_sd_1090)), 
         "outside sd range")
```

_where_ :

- `mean` = The average of all the data points collected in a 15 minute period for a sonde parameter.
- `rollavg` = A rolling average of 7 data points, with the data point that is being evaluated in the center.
- `m_sd_1090` = The seasonal standard deviation within the 10th and 90th quantiles for the season.
- `"outside sd range"` = Flag descriptor inserted into `flag` column.

## Analysis:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
sd_flag_data <- read_csv("data/flag_report.csv") %>% 
  filter(flag == "outside sd range",
         !(parameter %in% c("Baro", "Battery Level", "External Voltage")),
         data_points_flagged_percentage_sans_na > 0 | dates_flagged_percentage_sans_na > 0
         ) %>% 
  select(Site = site, 
         Parameter = parameter,
         `% of Total Data Points Flagged` = data_points_flagged_percentage_sans_na,
         `% of Total Dates Flagged` = dates_flagged_percentage_sans_na)

kable(sd_flag_data, format = "markdown", align = "c")
```


## Examples:

### Good

![Example of sd flag working properly](../../../data/QAQC_images/flag_examples/timberline_turb_sd_flag_good.png)

- Extreme outliers will be detected and deemed unsuitable.
- This flag is often associated with the seasonal range flag.
- This flag is often associated with the slope violation flag.

### Bad

![Example of sd flag working improperly](../../../data/QAQC_images/flag_examples/timberline_turb_sd_flag_bad.png)

- When several points are following a suspicious trend they are captured in the rolling average window and do not get flagged.
- Fortunately, as this flag is often associated with other flags, those other flags will get triggered as well.
