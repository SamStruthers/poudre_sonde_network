# add_flag()
# Add a flag to the `flag` column of a dataframe based on a condition and a description of the flag.
# The condition is a logical statement that is evaluated in the context of the dataframe.
# The description is a string that is added to the flag column if the condition is true.
# If the flag column is NA, then the description is added to the flag column.
# If the flag column is not NA, then the description is appended to the flag column.
# The description is separated from the existing flag by a semicolon and a newline.
