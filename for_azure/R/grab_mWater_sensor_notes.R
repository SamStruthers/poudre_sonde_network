#' @title Grab mWater sensor notes
#' 
#' @description
#' A function that grabs and cleans the sensor notes from the mWater API data. This function
#' grabs only notes where the technician is interacting with the sensor on site
#' (excludes sensor malfunction notes).
#' 
#' @param mWater_api_data A data frame with the mWater API data.
#' 
#' @return A data frame with the sensor notes that match the historical field notes
#' data frame.
