RDO was through the roof at around 13 and 170%, which might be telling of the proceeding issues. Otherwise turb was fairly high at around 50NTU. For calibrating, RDO read an error after successfully calibrating (which happened last time I was there) so I stopped the logs and restored calib defaults for RDO. Solved problem, except temperature would not stabilize (RDO did, however), and was taking an incredibly long time to read RDO. Had to restore calib defaults for conductivity, too, because it would go from yellow to red a bunch of times (once I did it fixed itself). Everything else went well. The sonde eventually started to tell me that RDO cap was not installed, tried switching caps, didn't work. InSitu said to change the sensor itself as it is likely having problems connecting to the circut under the cap. Tried grease as well, but when you go to live readings, there's just a red triangle (warning) for RDO. I set a test upload, and RDO data did not come through.

Live treadings showed conductivity at 757 (no sensor malfunction...I checked in standard solution), and despite RDO sensor being wacky, the RDO was sitting at 93%/6.73. Depth at 1.91ft. Removed all sensors to try and see if there was a bend to fix the wiper-conductivity (box data) issue. There was a slight bend but I couldn't fix it with my bare hands (SUPER slight bend). I found I could push the wiper cylinder down within the wiper port so I tried that. Then the wiper was put back on but made a terrible clicking noise and was being stopped on conductivity. InSitu told me there was a bend and that I may need to switch it or send it into them.",2023-07-17T17:10:00Z,2023-07-17T17:00:00Z,2023-07-17 10:00:00,2023,2023-07-17T17:00:00Z,0,NA
